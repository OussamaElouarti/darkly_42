# scarping

## Attack scenario

In robots.txt we found also a directory called hidden that has a lot of athor directories that also had a lot of directorie ect ..
but at the end of each last directory there is a file with text, I think that there is a flag if we follow a specific path so I created a script that parse everythinng and go to every end of evry path
the script in the same direcoty containing this readme.

To avoid this problem tryin to dissalow a specific file in robots.txt makes it look sus for hackers So you need to give access in webserver to this file to admins only.
