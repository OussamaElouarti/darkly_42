# Bad Redirect

In the footer of the home page there is 3 icon media with redirection to each social media

If we inspect the icons :

> href="index.php?page=redirect&site=instagram"

> href="index.php?page=redirect&site=facebook"

> href="index.php?page=redirect&site=twitter"

lets try to change social media name for example

> href="index.php?page=redirect&site=google"

We get redirect to a page with the flag

> GOOD JOB HERE IS THE FLAG : B9E775A0291FED784A2D9680FCFAD7EDD6B8CDF87648DA647AAF4BBA288BCAB3

To prevent this problem :

>> dont use redirection as much as you can


>> notify the user that he will get redirect to : name of the website
