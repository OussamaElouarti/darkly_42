# XSS FEEDBACK

XSS is cross site scripting its client side it allows an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

we can get the flag simply by entring script or alert in message or name inputs

To avoid xss probelm we need to sanitize the client input and never trust it
